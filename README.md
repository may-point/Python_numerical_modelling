# Python_numerical_modelling
Some examples of numerical modelling. with python
IVP Behaviour models and visually displays analysis using E. method of long time behaviour of solutions to a specific initial value problem.
These change depending on initial values of parameters chosen; with "b" values resulting in drastic behaviour change at various intervals.
Feel free to play around with intervals - hint: there are 4 distinct intervals, and some within 0 < b <1.
