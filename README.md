# Python numerical modelling
Some examples of my projects in numerical modelling with python.
## __IVP Behaviour__ 
This models and visually displays analysis using E. method of long time behaviour of solutions to a specific initial value problem.

These change depending on initial values of parameters chosen; with "b" values resulting in drastic behaviour change at various intervals.

Feel free to play around with intervals - hint: there are 4 distinct intervals, and some within 0 < b <1.
